In this project, this was taken from David Bombal on youtube, link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzYKzAHsdMg

After coming across this on youtube, I was interested in the term "Ethical Hacking", to be able to hack ethically, resolving
the problems that we face commonly. As David describes, many at times when we are in the working field, finding out Wifi passwords
to resolve certain connective issues can be a trouble and taking up this script from David allows me and many others to 
resolve that issue at work.
